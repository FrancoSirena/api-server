Boilerplate code for any API server that I shall need in the future.

API Server with JWT secure routes.

Main packages used:
- Mongoose
- Express
- Passport
- bcrypt

Server built using YARN as the package manager.

Following the guideline shown at the course " Advanced React and Redux: 2018 edition " from Udemy.

OBS:
- Must have a valid MongoDB server running, to configure the correct mongoDB URL just change it at `index.js`
